1) SELECTION SORT
def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        min_index = i
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]

# Example usage
arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
print("Before sorting:", arr)
selection_sort(arr)
print("After sorting:", arr)

#Selection Sort repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and places it at the correct position in the sorted part.
Selection Sort Algorithm:
1. Start from the first element as the current position.
2. Find the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array.
3. Swap the minimum element with the element at the current position.
4. Move to the next position and repeat steps 2–3 until the array is sorted.
