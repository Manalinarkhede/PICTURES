5) JOB SCHEDULING 
Each job has:
an ID a deadline a profit
We must schedule jobs so that profit is maximum, and no two jobs overlap (each job takes 1 unit time).

# Job Scheduling Problem

def job_scheduling(jobs):
    # Sort jobs by profit (highest first)
    jobs.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)

    n = len(jobs)
    max_deadline = max(job[1] for job in jobs)
    slots = [-1] * (max_deadline + 1)

    total_profit = 0
    job_sequence = []

    for job in jobs:
        job_id, deadline, profit = job
        # Find a free slot for this job (from its deadline backward)
        for t in range(deadline, 0, -1):
            if slots[t] == -1:
                slots[t] = job_id
                total_profit += profit
                job_sequence.append(job_id)
                break

    print("Selected jobs:", job_sequence)
    print("Total Profit:", total_profit)


# Example Input: (job_id, deadline, profit)
jobs = [
    ('J1', 2, 100),
    ('J2', 1, 19),
    ('J3', 2, 27),
    ('J4', 1, 25),
    ('J5', 3, 15)
]

job_scheduling(jobs)

# Job Scheduling Problem - Algorithm

# 1. Input:
# - Receive a list of jobs where each job has an ID, a deadline, and a profit.

# 2. Sort Jobs:
# - Sort all jobs in descending order based on profit to prioritize high-profit jobs.

# 3. Initialize:
# - Determine the maximum deadline among all jobs.
# - Create an array 'slots[]' to track free time slots for scheduling jobs, initially all empty.

# 4. Schedule Jobs:
# - For each job in the sorted list:
#     - Try to assign the job to the latest available free slot on or before its deadline.
#     - If a free slot is found, assign the job, add its profit to total profit, and record its ID.

# 5. Output:
# - Print the sequence of selected jobs.
# - Print the total profit achieved by the scheduled jobs.

# Key Points:
# - Each job takes 1 unit of time.
# - No two jobs can occupy the same time slot.
# - The greedy approach ensures maximum profit by choosing high-profit jobs first.
