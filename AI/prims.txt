Explanation 
The algorithm starts with one vertex (here index 0) and keeps adding the smallest edge that connects a visited vertex to an unvisited vertex.
It marks newly added vertices as visited and repeats until all vertices are included in the MST.
The result is a list of edges forming the MST with minimum total weight.

Algorithm (short):

Initialize a vertex as visited and MST as empty.
Find the smallest edge connecting a visited vertex to an unvisited vertex.
Add that edge to MST and mark the new vertex as visited.
Repeat step 2–3 until all vertices are included.
