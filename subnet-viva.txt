Subnetting means dividing a large network (like 192.168.1.0) into smaller networks (called subnets).
It helps in efficient IP address usage and better network management.
Each subnet can have its own range of IPs for different departments or areas.

A subnet mask tells how many bits of the IP address represent the network part and how many bits represent the host part.
Example:
For /24, subnet mask = 255.255.255.0
First 24 bits → network
Last 8 bits → host
255.255.255.0 in binary → 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

subnet_mask = (1 << 32) - (1 << (32 - prefix_length))
(1 << 32) means 2³² (total bits in IPv4 address = 32 bits).
(1 << (32 - prefix_length)) means remaining host bits.
Subtracting gives subnet mask in binary form.
Example:
For /24, (1 << 32) - (1 << 8) = 4294967296 - 256 = 4294967040
which equals 255.255.255.0.

This checks the first part of IP to find its class:

1–126 → Class A default mask /8
128–191 → Class B /16
192–223 → Class C /24
224–239 → Class D (multicast)
240–255 → Class E (reserved)

host_bits = 32 − prefix; total_ips = 2^host_bits; usable_hosts = total_ips − 2 (unless /31 or /32).
