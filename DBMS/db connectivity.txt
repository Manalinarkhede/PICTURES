Step 1: Install MySQL Server
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo systemctl start mysql

Step 2: Set root password
sudo mysql -u root
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'Abcd@1234!';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;

Step 3: Install Python and MySQL connector
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip3 install mysql-connector-python

Step 4: Create database and table
sudo mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE employee_db;
USE employee_db;
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    job_title VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);
EXIT;

Step 5: Write Python CRUD script
nano employee_management.py
# Paste Python code for adding, updating, viewing, listing, deleting employees

Step 6: Run Python script
python3 employee_management.py

-------------------------------------------------
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'Abcd@1234!';



Step 1: Install MySQL Server on Ubuntu

First, make sure MySQL is installed on your machine.

# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Install MySQL server
sudo apt install mysql-server

# Start the MySQL service
sudo systemctl start mysql

# Secure the MySQL installation
sudo mysql_secure_installation              // this step is not required


Step 2: Install Python and MySQL Connector

You need the MySQL connector library for Python.

# Update package lists
sudo apt update

# Install Python 3 and pip if they are not installed
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

# Install the MySQL connector for Python
pip3 install mysql-connector-python


Step 3: Create the Employee Database and Table in MySQL

Now that MySQL is installed, log into MySQL and create a database and table for employee records.

# Log into MySQL as root
sudo mysql -u root -p

# Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE employee_db;

# Use the database
USE employee_db;

# Create the employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    job_title VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);

# Exit MySQL
EXIT;

Step 4: Python Code for Employee Management (CRUD Operations)

Now, let's write a Python script to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the employee database.

Create a new Python file, say employee_management.py:

--------------------------python code   (employee_management.py)    -------------------------
import mysql.connector

# Establish MySQL connection
def create_connection():
    return mysql.connector.connect(
        host="localhost",      //tells Python where the MySQL server is //running (here, on your local computer).

        user="root",
        password="Abcd@1234!",  # Replace with your MySQL root password
        database="employee_db"
    )

# Function to add a new employee
def add_employee(first_name, last_name, job_title, department, salary):
    conn = create_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()   //cursor ? is the object you ll use to send //SQL commands and receive results.

    query = """INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, job_title, department, salary)
               VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s)"""
    cursor.execute(query, (first_name, last_name, job_title, department, salary))

    conn.commit() // permanently saves all the changes (INSERT, UPDATE, //DELETE) you made during the current transaction.
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    print(f"Employee {first_name} {last_name} added successfully!")

# Function to update employee details
def update_employee(employee_id, first_name, last_name, job_title, department, salary):
    conn = create_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    query = """UPDATE employees
               SET first_name = %s, last_name = %s, job_title = %s, department = %s, salary = %s
               WHERE id = %s"""
    cursor.execute(query, (first_name, last_name, job_title, department, salary, employee_id))

    conn.commit()
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    print(f"Employee ID {employee_id} updated successfully!")



# Function to fetch employee details by ID
def get_employee_by_id(employee_id):
    conn = create_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    query = """SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = %s"""
    cursor.execute(query, (employee_id,))
    result = cursor.fetchone()

    cursor.close()
    conn.close()

    if result:
        print(f"Employee ID: {result[0]}")
        print(f"Name: {result[1]} {result[2]}")
        print(f"Job Title: {result[3]}")
        print(f"Department: {result[4]}")
        print(f"Salary: ${result[5]:,.2f}")
    else:
        print(f"No employee found with ID {employee_id}")

# Function to list all employees
def list_all_employees():
    conn = create_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    query = "SELECT * FROM employees"
    cursor.execute(query)
    results = cursor.fetchall()

    cursor.close()
    conn.close()

    if results:
        for row in results:
            print(f"ID: {row[0]}, Name: {row[1]} {row[2]}, Job Title: {row[3]}, Department: {row[4]}, Salary: ${row[5]:,.2f}")
    else:
        print("No employees found.")

# Function to delete an employee
def delete_employee(employee_id):
    conn = create_connection()
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    query = "DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = %s"
    cursor.execute(query, (employee_id,))

    conn.commit()
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    print(f"Employee ID {employee_id} deleted successfully!")

# Example of how to use the functions
if __name__ == "__main__":
    while True:
        print("\nEmployee Management System")
        print("1. Add Employee")
        print("2. Update Employee")
        print("3. View Employee")
        print("4. List All Employees")
        print("5. Delete Employee")
        print("6. Exit")

        choice = input("Choose an option: ")

        if choice == "1":
            first_name = input("First Name: ")
            last_name = input("Last Name: ")
            job_title = input("Job Title: ")
            department = input("Department: ")
            salary = float(input("Salary: "))
            add_employee(first_name, last_name, job_title, department, salary)

        elif choice == "2":
            employee_id = int(input("Employee ID: "))
            first_name = input("First Name: ")
            last_name = input("Last Name: ")
            job_title = input("Job Title: ")
            department = input("Department: ")
            salary = float(input("Salary: "))
            update_employee(employee_id, first_name, last_name, job_title, department, salary)

        elif choice == "3":
            employee_id = int(input("Employee ID: "))
            get_employee_by_id(employee_id)

        elif choice == "4":
            list_all_employees()

        elif choice == "5":
            employee_id = int(input("Employee ID: "))
            delete_employee(employee_id)

        elif choice == "6":
            print("Exiting...")
            break

        else:
            print("Invalid choice, please try again.")

Step 5: Run the Python Script

Once the script is ready, you can run the employee management system using the following command:

python3 employee_management.py


Option 1: Update the Authentication Method for the root User

If you want to continue using the root user with a password, follow these steps:

Log into MySQL as the root user using sudo (because root uses auth_socket by default).

sudo mysql -u root  -- connect with assword first - ubuntu is password... then it willl connect and mysql will start. then change password.

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'Abcd@1234!';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
